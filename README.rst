Low Contrast Detectability for CT Toolbox
=========================================
**Low Contrast Detectability for CT (LCD-CT) Toolbox** provides a common interface to evaluate the low contrast detectability (LCD) performance of advanced nonlinear CT image reconstruction and denoising algorithms. The toolbox uses model observers (MO) to evaluate the LCD of targets with known locations in test images obtained with the `MITA-LCD phantom <https://www.phantomlab.com/catphan-mita>`_. The model oberver detection accuracy is measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the detectability signal-to-noise ratio (dâ€™_{snr}).  The LCD-CT toolbox can be used by CT developers to perform initial evaluation on image quality impprovement or dose reduction potential of their reconstruction and denoising algorithms.

Features
--------

- Creating digital replica of the background and signal modules of the MITA-LCD phantom https://www.phantomlab.com/catphan-mita.  
- Simuating sinogram and generate fan-beam CT scans of the digital phantoms based on the publicly available Michigan Image Reconstruction Tolbox (MIRT) https://github.com/JeffFessler/mirt.
- Estimating low contrast detectability performance from the MITA-LCD phantom CT images using channelized Hoteling model observer with Laguerre-Gauss (LG) channels and two options of Difference-of-Gaussian (DOG) channels and Gabor channels.

.. _installation:

Installation
------------

- Install Low Contrast Detectability for CT Toolbox by running:

    git clone https://github.com/DIDSR/LCD_CT

Then open the LCD_CT directory in Matlab (**version > R2016a**) or Octave (**version > 4.4**) and run `demo_01_singlerecon_LCD.m` to test the LCD estimation code.

If neither Matlab or Octave are installed, or you do not have an appropriate version please see `install.sh` to prepare an environment

.. code-block:: shell

        source install.sh

- Note that the LCD Phantom Creation code uses functions from `Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolkit (MIRT) <https://github.com/JeffFessler/mirt>`_. If it is not already installed, it will be downloaded and installed automatically when 'demo_test_phantomcreation.m' is run. If the automatic download does not work (possibly due to matlab upzip() function did not successfully extracted all the files), this can be done manually: 
1) download MIRT from https://github.com/JeffFessler/mirt; 
2) Upzip MIRT to a local directory; 
3) In Matlab, Run the file "setup.m" in the MIRT local directory to add all the MIRT subdirectories to the MATLAB workspace;  

To test whether the setup is successful, run **demo_test_phantomcreation.m**.

- LCD_CT is compatible with Octave, however some functions such as `medfilt2` are not loaded by default, follow the command line instructions, e.g.: `pkg load image` to have `medfilt2` available, this only needs to be done once for a given Octave session.

Getting Started
---------------

After installing review the LCD RST Documentation https://lcd-ct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ and the demos to learn how to use the tool to assess low contrast detectability:

- **demo_01_singlerecon_LCD.m**
- **demo_02_tworecon_LCD.m**
- **demo_03_tworecon_dosecurve_LCD.m**

Additional demos of tool usage can be found in additional_demos.

The following AUC-vs-dose curves were generated by demo_03_tworecon_dosecurve_LCD.m using the large data set saved in zonodo (https://zenodo.org/record/7996580) and the LG channelized Hoteling model observer.
